## Hi, I'm Matin Ghasemi 👋
**Bioinformatics & AI Researcher | M.Sc. @ Amirkabir University of Technology**

I am a researcher specializing in the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Biology**. My work focuses on developing deep learning frameworks for medical image analysis, genomics, and Spatial Transcriptomics to advance precision medicine and healthcare diagnostics.


### 🧬 Research Profile
I am currently a Graduate Researcher at the **Computational Biology Research Center (CBRC)**. My academic background combines a strong foundation in computer science with deep expertise in biological data analysis. I am developing deep learning models to predict spatial RNA-Seq profiles directly from H&E-stained histopathology slides, aiming to make high-resolution spatial data more accessible and clinically applicable.

**Keywords:** Spatial Transcriptomics, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Digital Pathology, Multi-omics Integration.
