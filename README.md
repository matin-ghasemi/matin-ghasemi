## Hi, I'm Matin Ghasemi 👋
**Bioinformatics & AI Researcher | M.Sc. @ Amirkabir University of Technology**

I am currently a Graduate Researcher at the **Computational Biology Research Center (CBRC)**. I am developing deep learning models to predict spatial RNA-Seq profiles directly from H&E-stained histopathology slides, aiming to make high-resolution spatial data more accessible and clinically applicable.


### 🔍 Research Interests
* **AI in Healthcare:** Medical Image Analysis & Deep Learning.
* **Computational Biology:** Spatial Transcriptomics & Omics Data Integration.
* **Precision Medicine:** Cancer Research & Diagnostic Biomarkers.





### 📂 Key Research Projects

- #### 🔬 Spatial RNA-Seq Prediction (M.Sc. Thesis)
  * Developing a multimodal pipeline to predict spatial transcriptomics from Whole-Slide Images (WSI).
  * Integrating **Vision Transformers** and **GNNs** to model spatial relationships in tissue.

- #### 🧠 MS Lesion Segmentation (Competition Winner)
  * Developed an end-to-end medical imaging pipeline for MRI analysis.
  * Achieved 1st place with a 10% Dice Score margin.
- #### 💊 Graph-Based Drug-Target Interaction
  * Implemented **Graph Neural Networks** to predict interactions between drugs and biological targets.
